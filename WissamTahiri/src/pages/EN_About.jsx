                Let me introduce myself : I'm <strong>Wissam Tahiri</strong>, a{" "}

                Passionate about development in all its forms, I am also

                <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>: its impact on current
                technologies and the huge possibilities it opens for the future.

            I am currently in the <u>second year</u> of my{" "}
            <strong>engineering program</strong>{" "}
            <em>(equivalent to a Master's level / Bac+4)</em> at Sup GalilÃ©e. I
            am actively looking for a <strong>2 to 4-month internship</strong>{" "}
            or a <strong>work-study opportunity</strong> to further develop my
            practical skills in the field.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout my studies, I have particularly enjoyed the fields of{" "}
            <strong>Web development</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>software development</strong>, and{" "}
            <strong>system administration</strong>, which I would like to
            explore further in a professional context.
          </p>

          <p>
            Curious, rigorous, and motivated, I am eager to join a dynamic team
            where I can <u>apply my knowledge</u>, <u>learn new technologies</u>
            , and <u>contribute to concrete projects</u>.

          <h3>My philosophy</h3>
          <div className="flex-row">
            <div className="text-col">
              <p>
                I'm mostly looking for <strong>understanding</strong> how things
                work and <u>exploring</u> the mechanisms behind them. <br />
                But what I like the most is seeing them <u>come to life</u>:
                transforming an abstract idea into a real and working system
                through functional code. That is where{" "}
                <strong>my true motivation</strong>
                lies.
              </p>
              <p>
                For me, nothing beats <strong>hands-on experience</strong>: itâ€™s
                by experimenting that we learn, progress, and fully engage in
                the design of a project â€“ all while discovering the{" "}
                <strong>technologies</strong> related to it.

            After a <strong>Scientific Baccalaureate</strong> with honors and an
            unsuccessful year in medicine, I decided to redirect myself towards
            my second area of interest: <u>engineering</u>. To do this, I went
            through the <strong>"Classe PrÃ©pa"</strong> of <u>Sup GalilÃ©e</u>{" "}
            which is a special 2 years course in France to warm us up to the
            engineering classes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout these two years, I have developed a solid foundation in :{" "}

            After those 2 years, I joined the{" "}
            <strong>Computer Science Engineering Classes</strong> of Sup GalilÃ©e
            , where I am currently in my second year out of three.
          </p>

          <p>
            I suceeded in my first year, consolidating my knowledge and by
            discovering new subjects :
